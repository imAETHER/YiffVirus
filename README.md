# Yiff Desktop "Virus" #
â˜† Heavy inspiration from [NathanKassab's Desktop Flooder](https://github.com/NathanKassab/Yiff-desktop-flooder)

## What it does: ##
1) Changes the icon of all folders in the desktop to a NSFW image
2) Changes the all the file's names in those folders to something random
3) After that, it moves up to the desktop and renames the files like (2)
4) Changes the desktop background to MORE NSFW
5) It opens some nice websites in default browser 
6) at the end it just floods the whole desktop with like 250 images lol
